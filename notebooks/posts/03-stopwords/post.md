- [20 most frequent words across narrative time]
- circle back to the plot of frequency vs bin count variance
- [log-log, ratio coloring]
- not just that almost all of the words sit above the expected baseline - clear that the slope of the data is actually higher than this, that words actually before more non-uniform as they before more frequent, even when comparing to the expected rise in variance along with frequency
- indeed, when you score the words by dividing the observed variance by the expected - the number of times greater the observed is than the expected - the most frequent words score as the most non-uniform of everything in the dictionary, and by a fairly wide margin. here are the top 100 words, ranked by this ratio between observed / expected variance:
- [top 100]
- this set of the top 100 contains XX of the most frequent words in the dictionary; and, if you skim off the top XX words, you get all of the 100 most frequent words in the language
- what to make of this? it's is kind of bizarre, in a sense, and not what I expected going in - I assumed that function words would be (almost) totally flat, since I don't think of them as having any kind of semantic "focus" that would attach them to any particular part of the narrative interval.
- usually, when something correlates with frequency like this, it feels like a rag flag, the worry being that you're somehow just reproducing the fact that frequent words are frequent, infrequent words are infrequent.
- as a sanity check, I re-ran the exact same feature extraction job on the corpus, but this time, for each text, before adding up the bin counts, I just randomly shuffled the words in the text, to destroy any kind of narratological ordering. and sure enough with this, the variances clamp right onto the expected line:
- [log-log, shuffled]
- so, I think there is actually some meaningful way in which high frequency words are actually the most non-uniform across narrative time? but, I'm not really sure how to interpret this. am I wrong to be surprised by this? is it somehow tautologically true, is there some kidn of statistical / lingustic / narratological truism that would make it impossible for this not to be the case, in some sense?
- part of the reason this feels counterintuitive, I think, is that this question of what it means for a word to be narratologically "non-uniform" or "surprising" is actually less cut-and-dry than it first seemed to me, and interacts in interesting ways with the overall frequency of the word.
- for example, take the word "a," which is the Nth most frequent word in English and appears XX times in the corpus, and "gun," which appears XX times:
- [a, gun histograms]
- which of these is more "surprising"? if you think of them in terms of probability distributions, "gun" obviously has the much more dramatic trend - a huge spike around the X% marker, the moment of crime / climax, where it literally doubles in volume relative to the baseline across the first half of the narrative. indeed, if you treat them as density functions - throwing out information about the overall frequencies - and then compare them to the expected uniform distribution using pretty much any measure of statistical distance (euclidean, wasserstein, bray-curtis), "gun" will always score as much more "non-uniform" by a large margin. just using the euclidean distance, the metric I used before for the hierarchical cluster - "gun" has a distance of XX from the uniform, "a" of YY.
- [a, gun, relativized series]
- meanwhile "a," as a density function, is much "flatter." but, when you remember the actual footprint of the word in the corpus - "a" appears XX times in the corpus, which represents about 2% of all words in all 27k novels - the total quantity of linguistic "mass" that's getting displaced here is sort of fascinating and bizarre. in the first percentile, "a" appears XX times more than you'd expect, and XX fewer times than you'd expect in the last percentile. here again, plotted with an error bar around the expected uniform distribution - if the frequency of "a" had no relationship with narrative location, the bin counts would fall inside the gray band within 2 standard deviations:
- [a]
- "a" is flatter, but, since it's so frequent, it represents a kind of massive, tectonic displacement of words, sort of like the gravity of the moon pulling the tide in and out - the water only rises and falls a couple of feet, but in order for that to happen the entire mass of the ocean has to get moved around. the amount of narratological energy needed to produce the "a" trend seems much larger than for "gun."

- so, what to make of "a"? high at the very beginning, a fast falloff, declining more slowly across the middle, then falling off quickly again at the very end. "an" is almost identical, with more noise in the sample, since it's less frequent:
- [an]
- there's an easy explanation for this, though I'm kind of fascinated by the fact that it (seems to) show up at the scale of entire narrative, and not just inside of individual passages - "a" is used when a noun is introduced for the first time, when an object makes its first appearance in some context. eg, you might say - "a man was walking down the street" - but then, after that, you'd switch to the definite article - "the man walked into a shop," etc. as franco pointed out to me, benveniste makes exactly this point in problems in general linguistics:
- [benveniste]
- so, with the caveat that this drifts considerably into speculation - maybe one way to think of this is to say that "a" is a kind of proxy for the *rate at which newness is introduced into the text*? at the beginning, this is very high, as the fictive world is painted into existence, people and places are introduced, the pieces of the narrative are put into place. it then falls off rapidly after the beginning once the stage is set and the plot starts to spool out, as the fictive matter introduced at the beginning shifts into the register of the definite "the." then, over the course of the middle, the plot continues to move into new fictional space - new people, new places, new objects - but more slowly than at the beginning, which had to bootstrap the entire world into existence from the ground up. and finally, at the end, this rate of movement falls off quickly around the 95% mark - as if the text arrives at its ending point a bit early and stays there for a beat. "a," in other words, gives an empirical signals for the "speed" of the novel, in one sense of the idea - the degree to which it is moving into new fictive contexts that have to be introduced for the first time, as opposed to staying put inside of contexts that have already been blocked in by the preceeding narrative.
