New @literarylab blog post - The (weird) distributions of function words across novels.

A write-up of stuff I've been tweeting about for a couple months - thanks @jurafsky, @scottenderle, @quadrismegistus, and @mljockers for helping me think through some of this!

Some of the weirder stuff - I still can't figure out "the," which, at the end, diverges from the overall trend for nouns:

Determiners are all over the place - this, that, these, those:

Which split on singular / plural, not near / far. "This" and "that" are high in the middle, maybe in dialogue, as @jdporterlive noticed?

Whereas "these" and "those" are high at the start, and split at the end:

The "how much?" determiners:

"All" at the end makes sense, but not sure about "some" at 20%, "no" at 80%:

"Each" spikes at the end, but not "every":

The verbs "to be" are really structured:

And split cleanly into present tense:

And past tense:

Subject and object pronouns are similar - very low at the start, rising across the middle:

I guess - pronouns are missing at the start because you first have to refer to people / things by nouns? Eg - "David" before "he"?

Whereas, possessive pronouns are all over the place at the start:

Generally, at the start - the possessive is highest, then the subject, then the object.

But, this fascinates me - for "him" and "her," the object overtakes the subject across the narrative:

So, people increasingly become grammatical *objects* across narratives, things increasingly happen to them?

Punctuation is also really varied:

Questions in the middle, exclamations at the end!

And, periods and commas:

Where I suppose - the more periods, the shorter the sentences? And with shorter sentences, fewer the commas?

Anyway, next step is to try to use these trends to train classifiers that can "unshuffle" novels, as proposed by @Ted_Underwood.
